#The Python print() function is often used to output variables.

x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)

print("--------------")
#In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

print("--------------")
#You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)

#As we learned in the Python Variables chapter, we cannot combine strings and numbers like this:
age = 36
txt = "My name is John, I am " + age
print(txt)
print("")

F-Strings
F-String was introduced in Python 3.6, and is now the preferred way of formatting strings.
To specify a string as an f-string, simply put an f in front of the string literal, and add curly brackets {} as placeholders for variables and other operations.
